3. **Withdrawals**:
   - Creators can withdraw tips after a cooldown period.
4. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Limits tips per user within 24 hours to prevent abuse.
5. **Upgradable Proxy**:
   - Uses a proxy pattern for upgradability without losing state.

### Frontend

   - Easy tipping, creator registration, and withdrawals.
2. **Creator Profiles**:
   - Displays creator details and tip history.
3. **Wallet Integration**:

## Security Highlights

3. **Pausable**:
   - Admins can pause the contract in emergencies.
4. **Input Validation**:
   - Ensures all inputs are valid and safe.
5. **Proxy Security**:
